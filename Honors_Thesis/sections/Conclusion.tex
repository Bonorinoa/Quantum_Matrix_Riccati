\chapter*{Conclusion}
In this project, some cases of the matrix Riccati equations have been considered. Specifically, the case where $B = 0$, $A \cdot D = -I$ and $A \cdot C \cdot A^{-1} + A' \cdot A^{-1} = S$ where $S$ is a matrix with constant entries and diagonalizable. We have presented a mathematical proof to show that solving large Matrix Riccati equations is indeed a suitable task for quantum computers. Moreover, the insights obtained from our mathematical analysis were encoded into the classical component of a hybrid architecture that, when coupled with HHL algorithm, shows promising results for solving such large linear systems. 

For further research, one can explore the cases where $S$ is not diagonalizable, $B \neq 0$ or the matrix $A$ is not invertible. Moreover, the quantum component of QRS can be improved in many dimensions. We intend to test modern hybrid architectures, optimize the program to run more efficiently on quantum hardware and explore the behavior of QRS when certain conditions are relaxed to generalize the model.
