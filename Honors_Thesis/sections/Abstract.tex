\chapter*{Abstract}
Solving large linear systems is a task ubiquitous in science. At the time of writing the most efficient method is called the Conjugate Gradient method with complexity $O(N \cdot s \cdot k \cdot log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Nevertheless, this approach soon hit a ceiling with Big Data and massive data sets. Quantum algorithms have been recently proposed to handle these high-dimensional data sets. In 2009, Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd from MIT presented a quantum algorithm to approximate the function of the solution large linear systems with complexity $\frac{O(log(N) \cdot s^2 \csot k^2}{\epsilon}$, given the system meets certain conditions. Unfortunately, quantum hardware must be improved to reliably exploit the exponential advantage they claim. Hence, growing emphasis has been recently placed in hybrid architectures, composed of both a classical and a quantum component, better suited for small quantum computers. Here, we propose a mathematical proof and a hybrid algorithm to solve a high-dimensional Matrix Riccati equation using IBM's quantum lab and HHL solver package.
