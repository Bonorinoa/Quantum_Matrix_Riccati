# Quantum_Matrix_Riccati
Repository containing the deliverables of my Honors Thesis requirement for Marist College Honors program. I explore the suitability of solving large Matrix Riccati systems with quantum computing. Specifically, we propose a mathematical proof and hybrid algorithm which shows promising results.
